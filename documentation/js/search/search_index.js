2º de Desarrollo de aplicaciones móviles (DAM).\nLa aplicación está realizada en Angular e Ionic, utiliza una base de datos de Firebase y está en producción en Netlify. También utiliza servicios de Capacitor.\nLink en producción: https://carcare-firebase.netlify.app\nTecnologías Utilizadas\nIonic:\n   Ionic CLI                     : 7.2.0\n   Ionic Framework               : @ionic/angular 7.5.4\n   @angular-devkit/build-angular : 16.2.10\n   @angular-devkit/schematics    : 16.2.10\n   @angular/cli                  : 16.2.10\n   @ionic/angular-toolkit        : 9.0.0\nCapacitor:\n   Capacitor CLI      : 5.5.1\n   @capacitor/android : 5.5.1\n   @capacitor/core    : 5.6.0\n   @capacitor/ios     : not installed\nUtility:\n   cordova-res : not installed globally\n   native-run  : 1.7.4\nSystem:\n   NodeJS : v20.11.0\n   npm    : 10.2.4\n   OS     : Windows 10\nRequisitos del proyecto\nTecnologías a usar\nFrontEnd:\nAngular + Ionic + Capacitor\nBackEnd:\nServicio de autenticación de Firebase y base de datos Firestore Database desplegado de forma pública en la red.\nNúcleo de la app\n\nCrea un core en tu aplicación donde se añadirán los servicios y utilidades que no dependen de un módulo y que pueden ser importados desde cualquier sitio. (Servicios, interfaces, etc…). Puedes llamarlo core.\n\nMódulos\n\nCada página debe ser un módulo independiente.\nTienes que tener un módulo compartido donde añadirás todo aquello que pueda ser usado en otros módulos. (componentes, directivas y pipes). Puedes llamarlo SharedModule.\n\nServicios\nAutenticación\n\nUn servicio de autenticación con opciones para hacer login, logout y registro.\n\nAcceso a datos\n\nUn servicio por cada modelo de datos de la base de datos con métodos para poder hacer las operaciones CRUD sobre dicho modelo.\n\nApiService\n\nUn servicio de api que contiene la lógica necesaria para comunicarse con el backend.\n\nHttpClientWebProvider (HttpClientProvider)\n\nUn servicio de Http para browser que envuelve las llamadas a HttpClient\n\nLocalService\n\nUn servicio para manejar el idioma con el que se carga la aplicación. Deberá guardar la configuración del idioma seleccionado en el almacenamiento interno del navegador. Hace uso del servicio TranslateService para establecer el idioma seleccionado.\n\nTranslateService\n\nHaz uso de este servicio incluido en el paquete @ngx-translate/core para ello sigue las instrucciones que el profesor te dio en clases para importar el servicio de forma forRoot y forChild en cada uno de los módulos.\n\nDirectivas\nCrea al menos una directiva personalizada.\nHaz uso de al menos 2 de las directivas siguientes:\n\nngIf (obligatoria)\nngFor (obligatoria)\nngStyle (opcional)\nngClass (opcional)\n\nPipes\n\nCrea al menos un pipe personalizado y haz uso del mismo en tu app.\nUsa los pipes de angular (uppercase, translate, date, …)\n\nComponentes\n\nCrea componentes para contener las páginas, formularios para editar o añadir datos, visualización de registros de las tablas etc…\nHaz uso de la interfaz ControlValueAccessor en algún componente y úsalo dentro de algún formulario reactivo.\n\nFormularios Reactivos\n\nCrea al menos un formulario reactivo por cada modelo de datos que tengas.\n\nModales\n\nHaz uso de los modales por ejemplo para los formularios reactivos o para otra cosa que se te ocurra.\n\nPáginas\nHabrá al menos:\n\nUna página de login\nUna página de registro\nUna página de horme\nUna página de about. Tiene que tener información sobre la app y el desarrollador, con enlaces externos que se abrirán en otra pestaña.\nUna página por cada modelo de datos\n\nEnrutamiento\n\nOrganiza tus páginas en el enrutador de la aplicación y protege las mismas que necesiten un usuario autenticado mediante una guarda que debes implementar.\n\nInterfaz de usuario\n\nTu app debe ser responsiva.\nHaz uso de los componentes de ionic.\nConfigura el tema de ionic para cambiar los colores corporativos que se añaden por defecto.\nHaz uso de componentes de PrimeNg (opcional).\n\nDocumentación del proyecto\nEn la carpeta documentation del repositorio está disponible la documentación del proyecto.\nÉste ese un resumen de los principales elementos utilizados en la aplicación.\n\nProyecto en marcha\nLink al video demostrativo del funcionamiento de la aplicación.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkaSsS3durw\nLa aplicación inicia con un control de acceso, ya que comprueba si el usuario está autenticado en Firebase. Si lo está, lo redirige a la página principal de la aplicación. En caso contrario, lo lleva a la página de login y registro.\n\nUna vez dentro de la aplicación, el usuario podrá dar de alta vehículos, proveedores y cuando ya tenga tanto proveedores como vehículos, podrá crear gastos asignados al vehículo que indique.\n\nPantalla inicial con el menú desplegado.\n\nVentana modal de creación, edición y eliminación de vehículos.\n\nVentana modal de creación, edición y eliminación de gastos.\n\nPantalla de vehículos.\n\nPantalla de proveedores.\n\nPantalla de creación, edición y eliminación de proveedores.\n\nPágina 'Sobre mí'.\n\nPágina de administración.\n\n\nPágina inicial con el servicio de traducción en inglés.\n\nModo responsive en móvil.\n\n\n\n\nCaptura del SplashScreen con el que se inicia la
